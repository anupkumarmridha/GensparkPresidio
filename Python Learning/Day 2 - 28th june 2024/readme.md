# Learning and Implementation of Python Concepts and Algorithms

## Overview

This README file documents my learning process and implementation of various Python concepts and algorithms. I have explored topics ranging from basic data structures to more complex algorithms, using documentation and chatbots like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Copilot for assistance.

## Topics Covered

### 1. String Manipulation
- **What I Learned**: Various string operations such as slicing, concatenation, finding substrings, and using built-in string methods.
- **How I Learned**: Used Python documentation and practiced through examples.

### 2. Functions
- **What I Learned**: Defining and calling functions, using parameters and return values, lambda functions.
- **How I Learned**: Followed tutorials and examples in Python documentation.

### 3. Tuples
- **What I Learned**: Creating tuples, accessing elements, immutability, and tuple unpacking.
- **How I Learned**: Explored official Python documentation and practiced with code snippets.

### 4. Dictionaries
- **What I Learned**: Creating dictionaries, accessing and modifying values, using dictionary methods.
- **How I Learned**: Referred to Python documentation and implemented various examples.

### 5. Sets
- **What I Learned**: Creating sets, set operations (union, intersection, difference), and set methods.
- **How I Learned**: Studied Python documentation and solved related exercises.

## Algorithms and Applications

### 1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- **Problem Statement**: Find the longest substring in a given string that does not contain any repeating characters.
- **Implementation**: Used a sliding window technique to solve the problem efficiently.
- **Resources Used**: Python documentation, online tutorials, and chatbot assistance for optimization tips.

### 2. Prime Numbers up to a Given Number
- **Problem Statement**: Print the list of prime numbers up to a specified number.
- **Implementation**:Implemented the algorithm to Print the list of prime numbers up to a specified number.
- **Resources Used**: Python documentation and online coding platforms for practice.

### 3. Sorting Scores and Names of Players
- **Problem Statement**: Sort and print the top 10 players based on their scores.
- **Implementation**: Utilized Python's class, oops & built-in sorting functions and lambda expressions for custom sorting.
- **Resources Used**: Python documentation and coding tutorials.

### 4. Cow and Bull Game Application
- **Problem Statement**: Develop an application to play the Cow and Bull game, similar to Wordle by New York Times, and maintain scores.
- **Implementation**:  Utilized Python's class, oops, implemented game logic, and score tracking.
- **Resources Used**: Python documentation, chatbot assistance for game logic, and Console bassed.

### 5. Credit Card Validation - Luhn Check Algorithm
- **Problem Statement**: Validate credit card numbers using the Luhn check algorithm.
- **Implementation**: Implemented the algorithm to check the validity of a credit card number.
- **Resources Used**: Python documentation, online resources explaining the Luhn algorithm, and chatbot support for edge cases.

## Advanced Techniques

### Lambda Functions
- **Usage**: Employed lambda functions for concise and anonymous function definitions, particularly useful in sorting and functional programming tasks.
- **Resources Used**: Python documentation and coding practice sites.

### List Comprehension
- **Usage**: Utilized list comprehensions for creating lists in a concise and readable manner, often used for filtering and mapping tasks.
- **Resources Used**: Python documentation and example-based learning.

## Learning Approach

- **Documentation**: Primary source of learning for syntax and detailed explanations.
- **Chatbots**: Used ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Copilot for quick assistance and resolving doubts.
- **Practice**: Solved numerous problems and implemented projects to solidify understanding.
